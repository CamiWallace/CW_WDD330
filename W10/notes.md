Client-side form validation
it is always better and faster to catch invalid data client-side
you should always preform both client-side and server-side validation
form validatoin: when your form has requirements to be submitted
validation done in the browser is client-side
validation done on server is server-side 
why validate?
    we want the right data in the right format
    protect users data
    protect ourselfs
there is built-in form validation (this has better performance than js but not as customizable)
js validation: very customizable but you have to write everything
built-in validation is done by using validation attributes on form elemnets
    ex: required, minlentgth, maxlength, type, pattern

Using Fetch
fetch API accesses amdn manipulates HTTP pipline
provides global fetch() method that fetches resources asynchronously across networks
Promise returned from fetch() wonâ€™t reject on HTTP error status
    ex: fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => console.log(data));

the simpilest fetch() takes one argument, the resource you want to fetch
the response object is a representation of the entire http response
we use json() method to extract the JSON body from response
this method returns a second promise that resolves without parsing

fetch() method can accept a second parameter -- an init object that allows you to control number of different settings
uploading JSON data --> use fetch() to POST JSON data
uploading a file --> HTML <input type="file" /> input element, FormData() and fetch()
uploading multiple files -->  HTML <input type="file" multiple /> input element, FormData() and fetch()
